# **API Testing using Rest Assured, Maven, TestNG**

This project is a demonstration of how to perform API testing using the Rest Assured library, Maven build tool, TestNG testing framework, and IntelliJ IDEA.

## **Prerequisites**
Java 8 or later  
Maven  
IntelliJ IDEA  


## **Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine  
2. Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA as a Maven project.  
3. Open the pom.xml file and verify that all the dependencies are correctly configured.  
4. Run the tests by right-clicking on the testng.xml file and selecting "Run 'testng.xml'".  

## **How it Works**

The project uses the Rest Assured library to make HTTP requests to the API and validate the response. 
The tests are written using the TestNG testing framework, and they are run using Maven and IntelliJ IDEA.

The tests are organized into test classes, and each test class contains one or more test methods that perform a specific test case. 
The test methods use the Rest Assured library to make HTTP requests to the API and validate the response.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to perform API testing using Rest Assured, Maven, TestNG, and IntelliJ IDEA. 
By using these tools and best practices, you can easily validate that your API is working as expected and catch any problems early in the development process.
